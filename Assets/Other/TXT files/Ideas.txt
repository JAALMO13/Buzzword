==================ISSUES==================



Queue system 
- add custom class
- Custom class contains player connection, room name, settings (min length, max length, time limit), password (if one)
- peek before dequeuing 
- if same put players in game dequeue and don't add to queue.


==================TODO IF TIME==================
web crawler for definitions
high score / leaderboards

maybe add coop (kinda simple)
- add toggle with label to game settings default off
- if true add scores at end
- good job instead of win/lose
- add all used words to one list and use distinct for no duplicates
- words found would be separate duplicates will not count 
- add scores together at top (gameoverview can stay the same)

new game modes 
==================TODO==================

test with 3 or more players (does not work unless host is in game)

build ipa file 

rematch button(disabled)
